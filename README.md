## Introduction
This project aims to analyze a dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and insights. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and predictive modeling.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization using various libraries
- Predictive modeling and evaluation

## Installation
To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mdadnanafzal/data-analysis-project.git
cd data-analysis-project
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To run the analysis, use the following command:

```bash
python analysis.py
```

You can also explore the Jupyter notebooks provided in the `notebooks` directory for detailed step-by-step analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project should be placed in the `data` directory. Ensure the dataset is in the correct format before running the analysis scripts.

## Analysis
The analysis includes the following steps:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, outliers, and data transformation.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Summarizing the main characteristics of the data.
3. **Data Visualization**: Creating visual representations of the data using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
4. **Predictive Modeling**: Building and evaluating machine learning models to make predictions based on the data.

## Results
The results of the analysis, including visualizations and model performance metrics, can be found in the `results` directory.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have any suggestions or improvements, please create a pull request or open an issue.
